# Deck Of Cards Workout

I created this program to teach myself a little bit of C++ and make staying healthy and active a little easier during the COVID-19 quarantine. The deck of cards workout is done with a standard deck of playing cards. The exercisee would assign an exercise to each suit and pick from the deck. The number on the card is the number of reps they would do of the exerise they associated with the suit.

This program replicates this without the actual deck of cards. On initialization, the user must enter an exercise for each suit. The program randomly pulls cards out of the deck and continues until all 52 cards are chosen. When a new exercise/card is selected, the program waits for the user to confirm all the reps are done (or you are done with your break) before continuing.

Shout out to my future brother in law for showing me this workout.
